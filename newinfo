Of course. It looks like the team has made significant progress on refining the application's features, UI/UX, and legal positioning. I have synthesized all the new information from the latest conversation into an updated project document.

This document incorporates the new "Reset Killer" mechanic, the detailed FAQ and "About" sections, and the latest UI/UX discussions, giving you a complete and current overview of the "Last Pigs Standing" project.

### **Project Update & Addendum: Last Pigs Standing (formerly NikePig)**

This document reflects the latest decisions and feature additions discussed on June 15-17, 2025.

### **1. New Core Feature: The "Reset Killer" Mechanic**

A new game theory event has been added to ensure the prize pool eventually pays out, creating high-stakes, predictable hype cycles.

* **Mechanic:** When a "Reset Killer" period is active, the standard 72-hour timer reset is modified. Each new deposit will reset the timer to **1 second less** than the previous reset, causing the countdown to rapidly diminish and making a final payout almost inevitable.
* **Schedule:**
    * The first Reset Killer will occur **1 month after launch**.
    * Subsequent Reset Killers will occur **every 6 months** thereafter.
* **UI Requirement:** The frontend must display a persistent **countdown timer** showing the time remaining until the next scheduled Reset Killer event.

### **2. New UI/UX Requirements & Refinements**

Based on team discussions and mockups, the following UI elements are now required:

* **High-Precision Timestamps:** In any table or list showing deposit history (specifically the "Last 100 Deposits"), the timestamp for each transaction must be displayed with **fractions of a second**.
* **Payout History:** The application must feature a section dedicated to showing the history of past payouts to build user trust and credibility.
* **Pool Visualization (Key Decision):**
    * **Guthix's Proposal (Leading):** The main landing page will focus exclusively on a large, impactful visualization of the **Main Prize Pool**. This is to maximize focus on the core game and avoid a cluttered "dashboard" look.
    * A separate page, accessible via a **"Stats and Daily Raffle"** icon/button, will display the sizes of the smaller pools (Daily Winner Pool, Token Holder Pool, NFT Holder Pool), potentially visualized as smaller piggy banks.
    * This approach avoids user confusion about where their deposit is going, as every deposit contributes to all pools simultaneously.

### **3. New Content Sections (FAQ, Warnings & About Page)**

The application must include the following informational sections, with the specified content:

#### **a) FAQ Section**
* To be located at the bottom of the main page.
* **Q: Are there refunds?**
    * A: No, your contributions are swallowed up into the void and there is no reversing it.
* **Q: Who built Last Pigs Standing?**
    * A: NikePig and Mister teams.
* **Q: Does the Last Pigs Standing have a maximum lifespan?**
    * A: No, it will continue until either no deposit is made in 72 hours, or a Reset Killer is reached.
* **Q: What happens during a Reset Killer?**
    * A: Each deposit resets the timer to 1 second less.
* **Q: When are Reset Killers scheduled?**
    * A: At 1 month after launch, and then 6 monthly after.

#### **b) User Warnings**
* A clearly visible warning must be included: **"Do NOT use a CEX (Centralized Exchange) to deposit your funds (because the payout will go to the CEX wallet that deposited, and not your own CEX receiving wallet)."**

#### **c) "About Last Pigs Standing" Page / Disclaimer**
* A dedicated page containing the full legal disclaimer drafted by Guthix. The key points to be included are:
    * **Positioning:** Frame the app as an "experimental decentralized contribution and ranking game," not gambling. The winner is the **"last 100 contributors,"** not the "top 100."
    * **Transparency:** Emphasize that all logic is on-chain and publicly auditable.
    * **Daily Prizes Language:** The daily random prize will be referred to as a **"daily reward draw weighted by contribution activity"** to avoid regulatory terms like "lottery" or "raffle." The updated text for this section is:
        > "Community Participation Incentives: In addition to the core ranking-based distribution mechanism, Last Pigs Standing includes daily community participation incentives... These incentives allocate small portions of daily contributions across multiple community-driven reward streams, which include: Proportional distributions to token holders, NFT-based community loyalty rewards, and Daily reward draws weighted by contribution activity..."

### **4. Developer & Project Management Update**

* **Project Name:** The official name is now **"Last Pigs Standing."**
* **Developer Status (`$cashcoldgame`):**
    * The Git repository is being set up.
    * A formal task manager will be used to track progress.
    * All new information (discussions, images, requirements) is being fed into a "knowledge store" to create a complete project plan before the first payment is made, ensuring full alignment.
