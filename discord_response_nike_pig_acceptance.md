# Discord Response - Nike Pig Team Contract Acceptance

## Professional Response to 8K Offer

---

**Hey Nike Pig Team,**

After careful consideration of the project scope and requirements, I'm ready to accept the **$8,000** smart contract development offer with the following professional terms:

### 🤝 **ACCEPTANCE WITH CONDITIONS**

**✅ I ACCEPT:** The $8,000 compensation for Aiken smart contract development

**📋 REQUIRED ADDITIONS:**

#### **1. Advanced Payment Schedule**
- **25% ($2,000)** - Upon contract signing & project kickoff
- **25% ($2,000)** - Completion of core contract architecture (Week 2)
- **25% ($2,000)** - Successful testnet deployment & testing (Week 4)
- **25% ($2,000)** - Final mainnet-ready contracts & documentation (Week 6)

#### **2. "Measure Twice, Cut Once" Protocol**
Given that smart contracts are **immutable once deployed**, we need bulletproof planning:

- **Week 1:** Comprehensive architecture review & approval
- **Milestone checkpoints** at each payment stage
- **No scope creep** - any additional features require separate negotiation
- **Final approval** required before mainnet deployment

### 🚨 **CRITICAL UNDERSTANDING**

Unlike our last project where revisions were possible, **blockchain deployment is permanent**. I'm already offering you a reduced rate, so we need to get this right the first time.

#### **What This Means:**
- ✅ **Thorough planning phase** before any coding begins
- ✅ **Detailed specification approval** at each milestone
- ✅ **Comprehensive testing** on testnet before mainnet
- ❌ **No major revisions** after milestone approval
- ❌ **No additional features** without separate compensation

### 📊 **Deliverables Included:**
1. **Main Prize Pool Contract** (72-hour timer, last 100 depositors)
2. **Daily Prize Contract** (token/NFT holder rewards)
3. **Treasury/Fee Contract** (1% transaction fee, 5% team cut)
4. **Token Minting Policies** ($NIKEPIG, $MISTER)
5. **NFT Minting Policies** (Nikeverse, Mister NFTs)
6. **Comprehensive testing suite**
7. **Deployment documentation**

### ⚡ **Timeline:** 6 weeks from contract signing

### 🔒 **Quality Guarantee:**
- Professional-grade Aiken code
- Security-first development approach
- Testnet validation before mainnet
- Complete documentation package

**Are you ready to proceed with these terms?** Once we have mutual agreement, I can start immediately.

Looking forward to building something exceptional together! 🚀
