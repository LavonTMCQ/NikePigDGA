## 4. PROJECT TIMELINE

### 4.1 Development Schedule
**TOTAL DURATION:** Six (6) weeks from contract execution, or upon completion of all deliverables, whichever occurs first
**START DATE:** Contract signing date: contract execution date, 2025
**COMPLETION DATE:** Six (6) weeks after start date OR when all parties agree Milestone 4 deliverables are complete: delivery date, 2025

### 4.2 Milestone Timeline

### 4.3 "Measure Twice, Cut Once" Protocol
Given the immutable nature of blockchain smart contracts, both parties acknowledge and agree to the following protocol:

#### 4.3.1 Pre-Implementation Approval
- All architectural decisions must receive written Client approval before implementation
- No coding shall commence until comprehensive planning phase is complete and approved
- All technical specifications must be finalized and approved at Milestone 1

#### 4.3.2 No Major Revisions Policy  
- Once a milestone is approved and payment is made, no major architectural changes will be accepted
- Minor bug fixes and optimizations are acceptable and included in scope
- Any requested changes beyond minor fixes will require a separate contract amendment
- This policy protects both parties from scope creep and ensures project completion within timeline

#### 4.3.3 Approval Process
- Each milestone requires written approval from Client before proceeding to next phase
- Client has five (5) business days to review and approve each milestone
- Failure to respond within review period constitutes approval
- All approvals must reference specific deliverables and acceptance criteria
