## E

*   **eUTXO (Extended Unspent Transaction Output):** Cardano's accounting model, an extension of Bitcoin's UTXO model, which allows UTXOs to carry datums (state) and be controlled by validator scripts (smart contracts).
*   **Eternl:** A popular Cardano wallet.

## F

*   **Flint:** A Cardano wallet.
*   **FOMO (Fear Of Missing Out):** A psychological driver that can encourage participation in projects like NikePig, especially when a large prize or limited opportunity is perceived.
*   **Fungible Token (FT):** A type of token where each unit is interchangeable with another unit (e.g., ADA, $NIKEPIG).

## H

*   **Hard Fork:** A radical change to a network's protocol that makes previously invalid blocks/transactions valid (or vice-versa). Requires all nodes to upgrade.
*   **Hydra:** A Layer 2 scalability solution for Cardano designed to increase transaction throughput and reduce latency by creating off-chain state channels (Hydra Heads).

## I

*   **IPFS (InterPlanetary File System):** A peer-to-peer network for storing and sharing data in a distributed file system. Often used for storing NFT media.

## K

*   **Koios.rest:** A service providing API access to the Cardano blockchain.
*   **KYC (Know Your Customer):** Processes businesses use to verify the identity of their customers, often for regulatory compliance.

## L

*   **Layer 2 (L2) Solution:** A secondary framework or protocol built on top of an existing blockchain (Layer 1) to improve scalability and efficiency (e.g., Hydra).
*   **Leaderboard:** In NikePig, the public display of the last 100 depositors and their potential winnings.
*   **Lucid:** A JavaScript/TypeScript library for building Cardano transactions and interacting with smart contracts.

## M

*   **Main Prize Pool:** In NikePig, the primary smart contract holding all deposited ADA, paid out when the 72-hour countdown completes.
*   **Marlowe:** A domain-specific language (DSL) for writing financial smart contracts on Cardano, designed for ease of use and formal verification.
*   **Mesh:** A JavaScript/TypeScript library for building Cardano dApps.
*   **Minting (Tokens/NFTs):** The process of creating new tokens or NFTs on the blockchain according to a defined minting policy.
*   **Minting Policy:** A smart contract (script) on Cardano that defines the rules for minting and burning specific native tokens or NFTs.
*   **$MISTER:** A proposed fungible token for the NikePig ecosystem.
*   **Mister NFTs:** A proposed NFT collection for the NikePig ecosystem.

## N

*   **Nami:** A popular Cardano wallet.
*   **Native Token:** Custom tokens created on the Cardano blockchain that behave similarly to ADA, without requiring complex smart contracts for basic functionality.
*   **NFT (Non-Fungible Token):** A unique digital asset representing ownership of a specific item, piece of art, collectible, etc. Each NFT is distinct and not interchangeable.
*   **$NIKEPIG:** The primary proposed fungible token for the NikePig ecosystem.
*   **Nikeverse NFTs:** A proposed NFT collection for the NikePig ecosystem.

## O

*   **Off-Chain Computation:** Performing computations outside the main blockchain to reduce load and costs, with results potentially verified on-chain.
*   **On-Chain Logic:** The parts of a dApp's rules and operations that are executed and enforced directly by the blockchain's smart contracts.
*   **Open Source:** Software for which the original source code is made freely available and may be redistributed and modified.
*   **Oracle:** A third-party service that provides smart contracts with external information (e.g., price feeds, real-world event outcomes).
*   **Ouroboros:** Cardano's family of proof-of-stake consensus protocols.

## P

*   **Plutus:** The native smart contract development platform for Cardano, using a Haskell-based language (Plutus Core and Plutus Tx).
*   **Policy ID:** A unique identifier for a minting policy script on Cardano. Combined with an Asset Name, it uniquely identifies a native token or NFT collection.
*   **Proof-of-Stake (PoS):** A type of consensus mechanism where block creators are chosen based on the number of coins they hold (their "stake").
*   **Proportional Payout:** A distribution method where recipients receive a share of a total amount based on their individual contribution relative to others.

## R

*   **Redeemer:** Data provided when attempting to spend a UTXO locked by a Plutus script. It acts as an input or instruction to the validator script.
*   **Rarity Tiers (NFTs):** Categories used to classify NFTs based on the scarcity of their traits, often influencing their value and utility.

## S

*   **Scalability:** The ability of a system, network, or process to handle a growing amount of work, or its potential to be enlarged to accommodate that growth.
*   **Smart Contract:** A self-executing contract with the terms of the agreement directly written into code. They run on a blockchain and automatically enforce their clauses.
*   **Stake Pool:** A Cardano network node run by an operator that ADA holders can delegate their stake to, participating in block production and earning rewards.
*   **Staking:** The process of actively participating in transaction validation (similar to mining) on a proof-of-stake blockchain. In Cardano, this involves delegating ADA.

## T

*   **Tokenomics:** The study of the economic characteristics of a cryptocurrency or token, including its supply, distribution, utility, and demand drivers.
*   **Transaction Fee:** A small fee paid to the network (and potentially dApp operators) for processing a transaction on the blockchain.

## U

*   **UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output):** Represents a piece of cryptocurrency that has been received but not yet spent. In Cardano, eUTXOs can also hold state and logic.

## V

*   **Validator Script:** The Plutus smart contract code that determines whether a transaction attempting to spend a UTXO locked by the script is valid.

## W

*   **Wallet (Cryptocurrency Wallet):** Software or hardware that allows users to store, send, and receive cryptocurrencies and interact with dApps.

## Y

*   **Yoroi:** A Cardano wallet developed by EMURGO.
