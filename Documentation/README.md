# NikePig Documentation - Comprehensive Knowledge Base

This Documentation folder contains a comprehensive knowledge base for developing and understanding the Cardano smart contracts required for the "NikePig" decentralized application.

**üìÅ Location:** `/Documentation/` - Centralized documentation system for professional development tracking

## Project Overview: NikePig

NikePig is a perpetual, high-stakes lottery dApp on the Cardano blockchain. It aims to attract continuous participation through unique game theory mechanics, an ever-growing prize pool, daily rewards, and long-term payout strategies.

## Purpose of this Knowledge Base

This knowledge base is designed to consolidate all relevant information regarding Cardano smart contract development, security best practices, and specific architectural considerations pertinent to the NikePig project. It will cover:

-   **Cardano Fundamentals:** Core concepts of the Cardano blockchain relevant to smart contract development.
-   **Smart Contract Development:** Tools, languages (Plutus, Marlowe), and best practices for writing Cardano smart contracts.
-   **NikePig Architecture:** Detailed breakdown of the smart contract logic for game mechanics, prize distribution, and token/NFT interactions.
-   **Security Considerations:** In-depth analysis of potential vulnerabilities, security best practices, and audit preparation for NikePig.
-   **Tokenomics & NFTs:** Handling of project-specific tokens ($NIKEPIG, $MISTER) and NFTs (Nikeverse, Mister NFTs).
-   **Scalability & Performance:** Strategies for ensuring the dApp can handle high transaction volumes.
-   **Frontend Integration:** How the smart contracts will interact with the user interface.
-   **Compliance & Legal:** Considerations for open-sourcing, audits, and any relevant regulatory aspects.
